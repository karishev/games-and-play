This is the branch for the UI 2d game first.

I finished the UI game and added a feature to go back to previous node by adding a Stack that contains the history of user pressed buttons. I also changed the fact that the whole history is displayed, I found it hard to follow, so I updated it with one text of the button pressed.

Here are some screenshots:
