This is the FPS game, howver I had a hard time to create the enemies. I had an experience in Unity creating AI enemies, but I didn't have enough time to figure it out.

It was a nice experience to create the fps avatar and figure out the camera movements and how the hitting would work. 

I worked on the weapong, so the positioning is right. I don't know why, but the script from the ;ecture for shooting didn't work, so I had to change the script a little bit from another source. I also decided to add a crosshair for a better game experience.

Here are the errors that I stumbled upon and don't know what to do with them. Maybe I made a mistake in following the script.
