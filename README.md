This is the FPS game, howver I had a hard time to create the enemies. I had an experience in Unity creating AI enemies, but I didn't have enough time to figure it out.

It was a nice experience to create the fps avatar and figure out the camera movements and how the hitting would work. 

For my final project I worked on similar camera experience and I used cinemachine for following the main character. It is exciting how many assets there are in the Assets Store that people can use.

I do understand the idea of the enemies:


1. Create a raycast from the enemies with a set radius and if an object with a tag Player is in there -> shoot it
2. Anything outside of the radius is unreachable to the enemies.
3. Once finding the player -> enemies shoot the player by finsing the position of the object.

Should be a simple procedure, however, I wasn't able to implement it in time.
